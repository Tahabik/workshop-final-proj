## Getting Started
So for starting explaining what is going on in this repository we have to say thay this is a final assignment from the lucturer of the Computer Workshop's 
and is going to almost cover all the things that has been taught in the course and make the students gather all of their knowledge from this course.

##Directory Structure
Mainly we are working with git, github and LaTeX for this assignment and we can say that the whole repository is a LaTeX based repository and almost all the files are in .tex format. 
We have created a directory called .github which handles workflows and apply all the actions that are possible in github to the .tex files and we have managed a main.yml file and applied the procedures possible to be able to read all the files generated from the main.tex which is our latex code.
the most important thing that has been generated from the main.tex is the main.pdf which is a visualization of the code and is the main form of the doc we have written. and the ability to read this pdf file has been managed in main.yml

##LaTeX compilation
I have no idea what to write here 
i thing i have explained enough for such a small assignment in the secitons above.
Have a nice journey:)
