\subsection*{\Large 1.1 Repository Initialization and Commits}
For creating a repository for this project, first i opened my account and then in the repository section of the github i created a repository and named it "Workshop-Final-proj" and then 
cloned the repository into a local directory of my pc and synced it with my vscode where i'm editing this assignment right now and going to commit the changes so far right now after putting the dot

and i created folder .github which is workflow to i build and release my LaTeX files through github Actions.
